Like many people, I've enabled dark mode in macOS, I use dark color themes in Visual Studio Code, I turn on dark mode when browsing Reddit...the list goes on. So I decided to support dark mode in [True Positive](https://truepositive.app).

There's no way, at the moment, to switch to light mode: currently, the UI is only available dark. Don't hesitate to email me at [veeral.patel@truepositive.app](mailto:veeral.patel@truepositive.app) if this is a problem for you; we'll work on fixing it.

Here are a couple screenshots:
