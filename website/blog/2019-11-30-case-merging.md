[True Positive](https://truepositive.app) now lets you merge one case into another.
This can be useful when:

- You realize two cases you're working on (say a phishing email and a malware outbreak)
  are actually part of the same attack.
- You're working on a large incident response engagement. You create a case
  for each live response analysis you do, then merge those cases into one central
  case for the engagement.

## How it works

Merging a case into another simply marks the child case as "merged" and records
which case it's merged into. This also means you can merge multiple cases into a case.

Merging a case does not modify the child case nor the parent case in any
other way.
