Every case in True Positive has a status and a priority.

## Default statuses/priorities

True Positive ships with these three statuses out of the box:

- Open
- In Progress
- Closed

And these three priorities:

- Low
- Medium
- High

However, you can add, rename, and delete the default statuses and priorities to fit
your organization.

## Customize priorities

Instead of `Low`/`Medium`/`High`, here are some other priority schemes you might use:

- `P0`/`P1`/`P2` - see [this article](https://www.bluelabellabs.com/blog/a-primer-on-prioritization/)
