Add tasks to a case to track and assign the work that needs to be done for the case.
For example, you may create tasks for:

- Removing adware from an infected laptop
- Blocking an IP address in your firewall
- Gathering more information about the sender of a spearphishing email

Each task belongs to a group. A case may have task groups for `Triage`, `Containment`, `Remediation`, and `Reporting`, for example.

Task groups let you organize your tasks and help you remember additional tasks that you need to do.
