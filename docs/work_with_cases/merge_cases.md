You can merge a case into another case in True Positive. You may find this useful when:

- You notice two cases you're working on are part of the same attack.
- You're working on a large investigation, and you want to create separate cases for smaller analyses your team works on--such as reverse engineering a malware sample or timelining an infected host

> To merge a case into another case, you must be a member of, and have edit access to, both cases.
