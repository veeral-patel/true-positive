## From the web console

Click "Cases" in the top navigation menu. This will open a page listing all your cases. Then click "Create Case", which will open a modal like this:

Now choose if you'd like to create a case from scratch or from an existing template.

### From scratch

We suggest creating one-off cases from scratch. Simply provide a name, status, and priority for the case in the form above.

### From a template

For types of cases you encounter often, however, like phishing or commodity malware, you should [create case templates](/docs/administer/manage_templates) for them.

Then, you can initialize a case from a template in one click:
