To create a case in the web console, click "Cases" in the top navigation menu. This will open a page listing all your cases. Then click "Create Case", which will open a modal like this:

Now choose if you'd like to create a case from scratch or from an existing template.

## From scratch

We suggest creating one-off cases from scratch. Simply provide a name, status, and priority for the case in the form above.

## From a template

For types of cases you encounter often, however, like phishing or commodity malware, you should [create case templates](/docs/administer/case_templates) for them.

Then, you can initialize a case from a template in one click:

## From emails

Finally, you can create cases from inbound emails.

For example, you might want to create a case in True Positive from your phishing case template for every email that's sent to phishing@company.com

See [this link](/docs/integrations/create_cases_from_email) to set this up.
