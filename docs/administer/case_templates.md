Think about the last couple cases you worked on. Chances are, they fell into a couple major
categories: phishing, malware, IDS/SIEM alerts, etc.

And moreover, you probably followed a similar set of steps to resolve the cases of each category.

True Positive lets you define case templates for this very purpose, so that every case created from a
particular template:

- Is given an initial status, priority, assignee, description, and set of tags
- Is given a initial set of users and groups who can access it
- Is populated with a set of tasks for analysts to follow

## Create a template

To create a case template, visit `Manage > Templates > Case Templates`:

Then, click `Create Template`.

This will open a drawer where you can choose the default name, status, priority,
assignee, tags, and description for cases created from this template:

Now, click the title of the case template you just created and follow the instructions below
to start adding tasks to it!

## Update a template

### Basic info

The Info tab lets you update basic info about the case template:

### Tasks

Use the "Tasks" tab to populate cases created from your template with a set of tasks.

#### Create a task group

In True Positive, each task in a case are grouped into a [task group](/docs/work_with_casesTo/manage_tasks#task-groups).
Before you can add a task, you must create a task group.

Do this by clicking the "Create a task group" button in the screenshot above, which will open a modal like this:

#### Add task templates

First, you must define [task templates](/docs/administer/task_templates) for each task you'd like to add.
This is so you can re-use a task in multiple case templates.

Then, select the task templates you'd like to add in the input box under the task group you'd like to add them to, and click "Add".

### Default members

In True Positive, only certain users and groups are allowed to access each case. Learn more about the permission model
for a case [here](/docs/work_with_cases/restrict_access).

In the "Members" tab, you can specify the initial users and groups in your case template that should be granted access to cases that are created from this template, and choose what each user/group's permission level should be.

You can always add/remove users/groups from a case later.

## Create a case from a template

[Follow these instructions](/docs/work_with_cases/create_a_case#from-a-template) to create a case from a template. It's easy :)

## Delete a template

To delete a case template, click the trash icon next to the case template you'd like
to delete.
