Think about the last couple cases you worked on -- chances are, they fell into a couple major categories.

And moreover, you probably followed a similar set of steps to resolve the cases of each category.

True Positive lets you define case templates for this very purpose, so that every case created from a
particular template:

- Is given an initial status, priority, assignee, description, and set of tags
- Is given a initial set of users and groups who can access it
- Is populated with a set of tasks for analysts to follow

## Create a template

To create a case template, visit `Manage > Templates > Case Templates`:

Then, click `Create Template`.

This will open a drawer where you can choose the default name, status, priority,
assignee, tags, and description for cases created from this template:

## Manage users and groups

To delete a case template, click the trash icon next to the case template you'd like
to delete.
