## Invite a user

To invite a user to your True Positive tenant, simply enter the new user's email address
in the input box above.

This will send an email to the new user with a link to log in to True Positive, a unique username, and a long, random password.

The user can update his username and password after logging in by visiting
his/her Profile page.

## Disable a user

> For data integrity, True Positive does not let you delete users. You can, however, disable a user to prevent him/her from logging in.

Just click the lock icon next to a user to disable his account.

The UI will typically only list active users in input fields. However, the API makes no distinction between active and disabled users: if you would like to assign a case to a disabled user (as an example), you can do so in the API.
