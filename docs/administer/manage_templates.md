Think about the last couple cases you've worked on. Chances are, they fell into a few reoccurring categories,
and moreover, you followed a similar set of steps to resolve the cases of each category.

True Positive lets you define case templates for this very purpose, so that every case created from a
particular template:

- Is given an initial status, priority, assignee, description, and set of tags
- Is given a initial set of users and groups who can access it
- Is populated with a set of tasks for analysts to follow

## Create a template

Visit Manage > Templates:

Note that while you're creating a case template, you can't add tasks and users/groups to the template. To do this, create the template, click on its title once done, and follow the instructions under "Update a template" below.

## Delete a template

> You cannot delete a case template if there's an [inbound address](/docs/integrations/create_cases_from_email) that uses it.<br /><br />
> Delete the inbound address, or change the case template associated with it, before deleting the case template.

To delete a case template, click the trash can icon next to the appropriate template.
