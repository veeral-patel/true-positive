Think about the last couple cases you've worked on. Chances are, they fell into a few reoccurring categories,
and moreover, you followed a similar set of steps to resolve the cases of each category.

True Positive lets you define case templates for this very purpose, so that every case created from a
particular template:

- Is given an initial status, priority, assignee, description, and set of tags
- Is given a set of users and groups who can access it
- Is populated with a set of tasks for analysts to follow
