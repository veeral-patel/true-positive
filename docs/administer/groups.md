We recommend organizing your users into groups. For example, your security division may be divided into groups for AppSec, CorpSec, and Management. A user can be in multiple groups in True Positive.

You can add a group to a case. This way, when a user is added to a group, he/she also gains access to all the cases that the group can access.

This way, you don't need to add the user manually to every case.

## Create a group
