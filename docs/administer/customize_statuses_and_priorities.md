Every case in True Positive has a status and a priority.

## Default statuses/priorities

True Positive ships with these three statuses out of the box:

- Open
- In Progress
- Closed

And these three priorities:

- Low
- Medium
- High

## Customize

That being said, you can add/remove/rename statuses and priorities to fit your organization.

For example, cases in your organization might follow this flow: `Unacknowledged` -> `Under Investigation` -> `Writing Report` -> `Closed`. Great! Simply replace the existing statuses with these four statuses.

Or you may want a `P0`/`P1`/`P2` priority scheme--or a scheme mapped to your org's risk management methodology. No problem: replace the default priorities with your scheme's priorities.
