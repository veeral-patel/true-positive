You often do the same task in many different kinds of cases. For example:

- You collect the same initial forensic artifacts from your web server regardless of whether the attacker brute-forced a SSH password or exploited a vulnerability.
- You might block a domain in OpenDNS proactively, upon receiving threat intel, or to block C2 connections to it after an incident.
